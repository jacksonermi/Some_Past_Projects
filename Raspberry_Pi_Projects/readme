
game.py is a childrens game developed on a raspberry pi designed as a learning aid for young students. Using the LED sensor hat on the raspberry pi, it shows different 
shapes and spellings and prompts the user to choose the correct spelling using the joystick on the Pi. There are several levels and scores are tallied throughout play
where upon completion the final score is expressed. 

joystick.py is just a quick little project I did to change the location of the lit diode using the joystick on the raspberry pi. Moves it one space depending on the 
direction pressed on the joystick/user.
