
ML model designed to correctly predict type of bean. Cleans dataset and samples, balances dataset, finds optimal number of features using different numbers of PCA
components and LogsiticRegression models (done using pipeline/gridsearch). Once the optimal number of features is found, it trains and tests the logistic regression 
model and prints a classification report.

Using the dry bean dataset from UCI.
